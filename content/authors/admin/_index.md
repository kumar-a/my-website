I am working as a senior research fellow at the [Department of Botany](https://botany.puchd.ac.in/) of Panjab University, Chandigarh. My research interests include the responses of ecological structure and functions to climate change. Currently, I am working on the elevational pattern of plant distributions and diversity in the Siwalik Ecosystem.
