I am working as a senior research fellow in the *National Mission for Sustaining Himalayan Ecosystem (NMSHE)* project at [ICAR–National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources, New Delhi](https://nbpgr.org.in/nbpgr2023/). My research broadly focuses to understand the ecosystem structure and functions in the context of global environmental change. Guided by the values of collaboration, integrity, and open science, I aim to contribute meaningfully to ecological research and inform evidence-based management strategies.
