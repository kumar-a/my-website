Siwaliks is the youngest and southernmost foot hills of Himalayas. These youngest mountain ranges are considered as one of the most degraded ecosystems of the Himalayan landscape. Climate change, landslides, human encroachment, urbanisation and industrilisation are possessing serious threats to the ecosystem structure and functions in this region. This project aims to investigate the responses of ecosystem structure and functions to the climate change.
