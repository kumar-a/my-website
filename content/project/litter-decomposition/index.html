<p>Litter decomposition is an important process that regulates the nutrient release and carbon cycling. This project aims to investigate the patterns and determinants of decomposition rates across terrestrial ecosystems. Specifically, it focuses on the role of phosphorus and mycorrhizal fungi in decomposition processes.</p>
