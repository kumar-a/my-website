Coal extraction by opencast mining involves the dumping of overburden or mine spoil as large heaps. Overburden excavated during opencast mining has poorer soil properties due to non-salvage and inversion of soil profiles. These large heaps of overburdened materials can act as a serious threat to ecological integrity and, therefore, overall societal well-being. Plantations are often employed to establish revegetation and management of mine spoil, thus mitigating the effects of mining on the environment. This project evaluates the effects of woody plantations to restore the vegetation and soil properties on coal mine spoil in Singrauli coalfields of India.
