abstract: The Himalayan foothills or the Siwaliks have been considered as one of the most fragile ecosystems of India. The underlying cause of degradation includes natural settings (geological formation and climate change) and human-mediated pressures (sandstone mining, urbanisation and developmental activities). Since the Siwaliks is associated with the livelihood of about 20 million people, it becomes imperative to respond appropriately for sustaining this ecologically fragile region. Ecological principles have great potential to develop sustainable practices for the conservation and management of natural resources. These principles offer nature-based solutions to sustain the ecologically sensitive and degraded ecosystems such as the ‘Siwaliks’. However, there is a need for concerted research to develop data-driven decisions for effective management. Therefore, a systematic analysis was conducted to assess the current patterns and knowledge gaps about plant ecological studies in the Indian Siwalik region. This article analysed the available peer-reviewed literature using established guidelines and bibliometric analyses. We found an increasing trend in the scientific output, and most studies were concentrated in the Siwalik region belonging to the Indian state of Uttarakhand. Although studies have been conducted on plant ecology, landscape ecology and ecosystem ecology have been disproportionately focused. Our findings suggest a growing interest in the plant ecology of the region; however, these studies seem relatively small compared to the complexity and diversity of this ecosystem structural and functional attributes. Further, with advances in computer application and remote sensing satellite data availability, we observed a shift towards ecological modelling studies, though experimental evidence also needs to be addressed.
