abstract: Many wild edible plants have been traditionally used as foods and medicines among various ethnic groups. However, information about the nutrient components of these plants has yet to be scientifically tested. Therefore, this study evaluated the nutrient components of selected wild edible plants. It was found that nutrient content considerably varied among all the selected species. *Digera muricata* has the richest protein content among the selected plant species, and *Dioscorea bulbifera* has the highest fat content. Similarly, *Spondias pinnata* and *Boerhavia diffusa* were rich sources of vitamin-C and vitamin-E, respectively. *D. muricata* was found to be promising future food based on overall nutrient composition. These plants can offer a basis for developing dietary supplements and nutraceuticals on a commercial scale. Thus, scientific evaluation and validation of such underutilised plants and their products may prove an alternative future food.
