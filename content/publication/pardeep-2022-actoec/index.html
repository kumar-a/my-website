abstract: The present study was conducted to examine the status of herbaceous biomass development under rehabilitated coal mine spoil by establishing indigenous woody species in India's northern dry tropical region. Since mining activities for coal and minerals are prime industrial activities in this region; therefore, through these activities, a significant size of dry tropical forest ecosystems is destroying at unprecedented rates. Thus, the primary objective of the present study was to understand the influence of planted woody species on herbaceous biomass development. Estimation of herbaceous biomass was accomplished once in 1995 and 2007 under plantation stand of four native woody species. Among planted woody species, maximum herbaceous biomass was quantified at the 5th-year stand of *Tectona grandis* and lowest at the 17th-year stand of *Dendrocalamus strictus*. Family Poaceae contributed the maximum in herbaceous biomass production across all plantation stands. A declining trend was observed in herbaceous biomass production as the age of plantation stand increases, reflecting the impact of stand characteristics such as woody species basal cover and canopy cover on herbaceous vegetation development. Herbaceous biomass was positively correlated with species diversity at both ages of plantation stands, emphasising the facilitative role of species for organic matter build-up in disturbed habitats. However, increased competition between herbaceous species for space, nutrients and decreased penetration of light through the closed canopy of planted woody trees significantly influences herbaceous diversity under plantation stand.
