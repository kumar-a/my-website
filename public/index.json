In this context, we selected three sites in the western Himalayas, covering parts of Himachal Pradesh and north-eastern Haryana. Each study site experiences distinct climatic conditions, vegetation types, and elevations. We seek to elucidate the determinants of tree biomass and carbon stock across different forest types in the Western Himalayas. We found that temperate forests contributed the most biomass and carbon stock, with *Cedrus deodara* attaining the highest values of 782.6 ± 107.9 Mg/ha and 360 ± 49.7 Mg C/ha. In contrast, *Quercus leucotrichophora* mixed temperate had the lowest 286.6 ± 57.2 and 128.9 ± 25.7 Mg/C ha, respectively. Only a few species, such as *Abies pindrow*, *Cedrus deodara*, *Quercus floribunda*, and *Quercus semecarpifolia*, accounted for significant biomass and carbon stock. The lower elevation subtropical forests had the highest species richness (8–12 species) and stem density (558.3 ± 62.9 to 866.6 ± 57.7 trees/ha). Furthermore, tree diameter, total basal cover, and height emerged as the strongest predictors of biomass and C stock. The remaining variables showed no significant associations, including species diversity, climatic attributes and elevation. Thus, our study extended the assertion that vegetation composition and structural attributes, apart from climatic and topographic factors, are equally important in determining biomass and C stock in forest ecosystems. Our study indicated that the temperate forests in the western Himalayas possess significant carbon storage and climate change mitigation potential.","tags":["Biomass","Himalaya","Carbon Dynamics","Siwaliks"],"title":"Factors influencing tree biomass and carbon stock in the Western Himalayas, India","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anand Narain Singh","Abhishek Kumar"],"categories":null,"content":"\r Click the Cite button above to copy or download the citation into your reference management software.

The underlying cause of degradation includes natural settings (geological formation and climate change) and human-mediated pressures (sandstone mining, urbanisation and developmental activities). Since the Siwaliks is associated with the livelihood of about 20 million people, it becomes imperative to respond appropriately for sustaining this ecologically fragile region. Ecological principles have great potential to develop sustainable practices for the conservation and management of natural resources. These principles offer nature-based solutions to sustain the ecologically sensitive and degraded ecosystems such as the ‘Siwaliks’. However, there is a need for concerted research to develop data-driven decisions for effective management. Therefore, a systematic analysis was conducted to assess the current patterns and knowledge gaps about plant ecological studies in the Indian Siwalik region. This article analysed the available peer-reviewed literature using established guidelines and bibliometric analyses. We found an increasing trend in the scientific output, and most studies were concentrated in the Siwalik region belonging to the Indian state of Uttarakhand. Although studies have been conducted on plant ecology, landscape ecology and ecosystem ecology have been disproportionately focused. Our findings suggest a growing interest in the plant ecology of the region; however, these studies seem relatively small compared to the complexity and diversity of this ecosystem structural and functional attributes. Further, with advances in computer application and remote sensing satellite data availability, we observed a shift towards ecological modelling studies, though experimental evidence also needs to be addressed.","tags":["Plant Ecology","Siwaliks","Bibliometrics"],"title":"Plant ecology in Indian Siwalik range: a systematic map and its bibliometric analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ram Chand Bhatti","Rupinder Kaur","Abhishek Kumar","Viney Kumar","Siril Singh","Pardeep Kumar","Sheenu Sharma","Chongtham Nirmala","Anand Narain Singh"],"categories":null,"content":"\r Click the Cite button above to copy or import the citation into reference management software.

This problem has been increasing due to anthropogenic activities that affect the soils’ physical, chemical and biological properties with unprecedented rates. Thus, among various remediation technologies for soil contamination management, phytoremediation has emerged as a promising cost-effective and sustainable technology. Therefore, the present chapter highlights the recent developments in the concept, types, mechanisms of this phytoremediation as a cost-effective technology for contaminated soils along with future perspectives. Available literature suggests that it is a better technology to remediate contaminated sites than conventional strategies and is considered a cost-effective and eco-friendly tool. Phytoremediation includes a range of plant-based remediation techniques such as rhizofiltration, phytostabilization, phytoextraction, phytovolatilization and phytodegradation focused on a different degree of remediation mechanisms. Further, recent developments in understanding the mechanism of phytoremediation have opened the window for the engineering of plants for effective remediation of contaminants. However, the information regarding which plant species is ideal and appropriate for a specific type of waste and its mechanism of phytoremediation is not fully synthesized. Therefore, to find out suitable plant species for Phytoremediation purposes based on needs and mechanisms whenever is required in a changing environment is mandatory. It is also expected that ecological evaluation of the desirable and most applicable, especially indigenous plants that probably can play a promising role in the development of a database for future research aspects in remediation and decontamination of limited air, water and soil resources of the biosphere.","tags":["Phytoremediation","Soil Contamination"],"title":"Phytoremediation: A wonderful cost-effective tool","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anand Narain Singh","Abhishek Kumar"],"categories":null,"content":"\r Click the Cite button above to copy or download citation for reference management software.

These large heaps of overburdened materials can act as a serious threat to ecological integrity and, therefore, overall societal well-being. Plantations are often employed to establish revegetation and management of mine spoil, thus mitigating the effects of mining on the environment. However, the performance of plant species can be highly variable due to environmental and species-specific effects. Therefore, the present paper's primary objective is to compare exotic (*Acacia auriculiformis*, *Cassia siamea*, *Casuarina equisetifolia* and *Grevillea pteridifolia*) and native (*Albizia lebbeck*, *Albizia procera*, *Dendrocalamus strictus* and *Tectona grandis*) species' performance on the coal mine spoils. Previous studies on the Singrauli coalfields allowed us to compare the growth performance, standing biomass, and net primary production (NPP) of four exotic and four native species plantations. Our results showed that native species have significantly higher survival, stem diameter, biomass, and NPP than exotic woody plantations. Thus, exotic species might not be useful in mine spoil rehabilitation than the native species. Overall, this study suggests that native species are useful for mine spoil rehabilitation despite the faster growth of exotic species.","tags":["Coal mine","Restoration"],"title":"Ecological performances of exotic and native woody species on coal mine spoil in Indian dry tropical region","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pardeep Kumar","Abhishek Kumar","Meenu Patil","Nitin Kumar Sharma","Anand Narain Singh"],"categories":null,"content":"\r Click the Cite button above to copy or download citation for reference management software.

Thus, the primary objective of the present study was to understand the influence of planted woody species on herbaceous biomass development. Estimation of herbaceous biomass was accomplished once in 1995 and 2007 under plantation stand of four native woody species. Among planted woody species, maximum herbaceous biomass was quantified at the 5th-year stand of *Tectona grandis* and lowest at the 17th-year stand of *Dendrocalamus strictus*. Family Poaceae contributed the maximum in herbaceous biomass production across all plantation stands. A declining trend was observed in herbaceous biomass production as the age of plantation stand increases, reflecting the impact of stand characteristics such as woody species basal cover and canopy cover on herbaceous vegetation development. Herbaceous biomass was positively correlated with species diversity at both ages of plantation stands, emphasising the facilitative role of species for organic matter build-up in disturbed habitats. However, increased competition between herbaceous species for space, nutrients and decreased penetration of light through the closed canopy of planted woody trees significantly influences herbaceous diversity under plantation stand.","tags":["Biomass","Restoration","Coal Mine"],"title":"Herbaceous vegetation under planted woody species on coal mine spoil acts as a source of organic matter","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Deepika Antil","Pardeep Kumar","Abhishek Kumar","Meenu Patil","Anand Narain Singh"],"categories":null,"content":"  Click the Cite button above to copy or import publication metadata into their reference management software.

These fine roots sustain plant survival through the acquisition of water and nutrients from the soil. Fine roots are highly dynamic, having a small life span and a frequent turn-over which contribute to significant carbon input to the soil. Despite their importance to the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients, our understanding of fine root biomass, turn-over and dynamics are still impoverished, especially in tropical forests. Therefore, the present chapter is aimed to provide an overview for fine root biomass production, turn-over and their foraging efficiency under different environmental conditions. Fine root dynamics are profoundly influenced by several environmental factors such as seasonality, soil temperature and moisture, nutrient heterogeneity, as well as temporal and spatial variations in measuring techniques. Under nutrient heterogeneity, trees adopt different foraging strategies for resource acquisition through plasticity in morphological and physiological traits of fine roots. The type of plasticity responses varies widely among species and ecosystem types and nutrient patches. Tropical forests are highly sensitive to altered climatic conditions such as CO$_2$ enrichment, and anthropogenic nitrogen deposition. The available evidence indicates that fine root increases under CO$_2$ enrichment, while a negative correlation was observed with N addition in tropical forests. Despite playing a pivotal role in global carbon (C) cycling, the contribution of fine roots to ecosystem C models is poorly represented, probably due to difficulty in quantifying its precise quantity. Therefore, to understand the function and behaviour of tropical forest ecosystems under altered environmental conditions, broadspectrum studies are needed to gain information about fine root dynamics and their nutrient exploration efficiency.","tags":["Litter Decomposition","Carbon Dynamics","Tropical Forest"],"title":"Foraging efficiency of fine roots in relation to carbon dynamics in the tropical ecosystems in a changing environment: A synthesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pardeep Kumar","Deepika Antil","Abhishek Kumar","Meenu Patil","Anand Narain Singh"],"categories":null,"content":"  Click the Cite button above to copy or import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Importantly, they act as a natural sink for atmospheric CO$_2$ and play a pivotal role to offset climate change and related environmental perturbations. Unfortunately, due to the mounting pressure of the increasing human population to sustain a livelihood for food, timber, medicine, tropical forests are subjected to land-use change, deforestation, and degradation by industrial activities, especially mining. In addition to this, global climate change (increasing CO$_2$ concentration, temperature, drought, and fires might have a disproportional effect on carbon (C) flux in the tropical forests. The changes above should be considered in tropical dry forests (TDFs) research because these forests often neglected over rain forests despite having a sizeable geographical extent and significant pool of C in vegetation and soil. In the wake of the elevated concentration of atmospheric CO$_2$, the net gain in net primary productivity (NPP) and forest growth rate is getting consideration for tropical forests today, meanwhile other factors like temperature, drought, and fire likely to negate the positive effect of increased CO$_2$ concentration in the atmosphere. Recent studies designate tropical forests overall as C neutral since the loss of carbon due to deforestation and degradation is compensated by regrowth and recovery of past disturbances. So, there is an immense potential in the tropical forests to curb elevated CO$_2$ if policies and afforestation provisions and initiatives such as REDD+ if implemented effectively at the global level. In this chapter, we address the current state of knowledge on C stock and flux, and the magnitude of various disturbances (land-use change, deforestation), climatic perturbations (elevated CO$_2$, increased temperature, drought, and fires) on carbon balance in the tropical forests. Furthermore, we also discuss various research gaps for sustaining its structure, function, and ecosystem services; and recent methodological advancements for the estimation of C stock in the tropical forests.","tags":["Carbon Dynamics","Tropical Forest"],"title":"Impact of changing environment on carbon dynamics in tropics with special focus on tropical dry forest ecosystems: A synthesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abhishek Kumar","Meenu Patil","Pardeep Kumar","Anand Narain Singh"],"categories":null,"content":"  Click the Cite button above to copy or download the publication metadata into your reference management software.

These ecosystems substantially control global nutrient cycling. Although our understanding of carbon and nitrogen cycling has considerably improved during the past decades, phosphorus cycling in tropical forests still remains poorly understood. Tropical forests are characterized by severe phosphorus limitation and very high productivity at the same time. This suggests that tropical plants must have the capacity to adapt to such nutrient-poor environments, which should be reflected in the nutrient concentration of plant tissues via their phosphorus resorption efficiencies and the overall phosphorus cycling. This chapter aims to provide the general patterns and mechanisms of phosphorus cycling in tropical forests. Based on the available evidence, we first overview the general nutrient cycling pattern, then highlight the mechanisms of phosphorus control, and finally discuss the possible responses to climate change. Actually, phosphorus cycling involves soil, plant biomass, and litter as the storage components, and recycling of phosphorus takes place among these components. However, due to substantial loss of nutrients, the cycling of phosphorus tends to slow down with time. Studies involving the external supply of phosphorus have suggested a considerable enhancement in the phosphorus cycle, but this enhancement could not sustain over time. Climatic factors generally control many processes of nutrient cycling; therefore, ongoing climate change has been expected to alter the phosphorus cycling in the tropical forests as well. The available evidence suggests that warm-moist conditions will favor faster litter decomposition rates, whereas seasonality in precipitation will slow down the nutrient cycling. Therefore, in this chapter, we tried to answer how litter decomposability traits and the addition of phosphorus nutrient are controlling the cycling of nutrients in the tropical forest ecosystems under changing environmental conditions.","tags":["Litter Decomposition","Phosphorus","Tropical Forest"],"title":"Phosphorus and litter decomposability traits in tropical forest ecosystems under changing environment: A synthesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rajni Yadav","Abhishek Kumar","Diksha Tokas","Anand Narain Singh"],"categories":null,"content":"  Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

To accomplish this, we synthesized the available information by carrying out a literature survey and standardized protocols from available databases showing the variation in the respective traits of crop and weeds. And, it is found that there are certain specific LFTs such as leaf area, leaf size and specific leaf area are helpful to calculate the level of competition under weed crop interactions. So, these traits proved to be a good tool to screen out species for productivity and ecological performance in the species interactions. This confirms with previous findings that knowledge to measure the LFTs can improve the yield in response to weed competition and can be implemented by the farmers in the field. Also, this array of traits can help to minimize the use of different chemicals (weedicides, herbicides and pesticides) in weeds management under agro-ecosystems which affect the biotic factors such as soil biota.

Therefore, the present article aims to assess how many various types of disorders are being treated by ethnic groups using formulations prepared from this tree. In addition, we aim to identify the gaps in knowledge and recommend future investigations based upon them. The present analysis based on 83 articles indicated that different ethnic groups are utilising this tree to treat about 142 health ailments that can be broadly categorised into 11 types of disorders. Among these disorder categories, helminthic infestations, dermatological and digestive disorders are most frequently treated with formulations prepared from the tree. Among plant parts, fruits are the most exclusively used component followed by leaves and bark. The usage of fruits as an anthelminthic is widespread and highly cited for both animals and human beings. Thus, the tree can serve as a promising ethnomedicine to treat helminthic infestations, dermatological and digestive problems. Therefore, the cultivation of this medicinal plant should be encouraged in order to promote conservation of this species.","tags":["Mallotus philippensis","Ethnobiology","Ethnomedicinal Uses","Traditional Uses"],"title":"Mallotus philippensis (Lam.)

In wake of recent extinction, several forests are declared as protected areas where no more human activities are allowed. However, the scope of these protected areas got broadened from mere conservation to poverty alleviation and sustainable development during the past decades. Though these protected areas seem to be supportive of the biodiversity conservation, several challenges and gaps have emerged that need to be addressed for effective conservation and sustainable management in these protected areas. Therefore, the present chapter aims to address the roles, challenges, and approaches for conservation, and sustainable management in protected areas of India. Based on the published literature, we have found that protected areas proved to be a successful strategy for the conservation of wild animals and plants. However, management of poaching, man-wildlife conflicts, funding, extensive resource use, and tourism is still a challenge for some national parks of the country. Although governmental policies have addressed some of these challenges, only limited success has been achieved so far. Therefore, further studies need to assess the efficiency of protected areas for biodiversity conservation and devise the mechanisms for effective sustainable management of these protected areas.","tags":["Biodiversity Conservation","National Parks","Sustainability"],"title":"Sustainable management of national parks and protected areas for conserving biodiversity in India","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Meenu Patil","Abhishek Kumar","Pardeep Kumar","Navneet Kaur Cheema","Rupinder Kaur","Ram Chand Bhatti","Anand Narain Singh"],"categories":null,"content":"\r Click the Cite button above to copy or import the citation into your reference management software.

However, these effects are largely unknown for urban ecosystems, though they act as reservoirs of exotic plants. The present study evaluated the decomposition rates of five native and five exotic (three invasive and two non-invasive) species by conducting the litter bag experiment. Our study, however, did not find any significant differences in overall decomposition rates of native and exotic species but decomposition rates were strongly correlated with initial chemical quality of the litter. Further, litter carbon, lignin to nitrogen ratio and carbon to nitrogen ratio seemed to be good predictors for decomposition rates in this study. Interestingly, invasive exotic species had higher decomposition rate while non-invasive exotic species showed a slower rate as compared to the native species. In conclusion, our study indicates that invasive exotic plants try to maintain a higher chemical quality of litter than native and non-invasive exotic species which promotes their rapid decomposition. Thus, the better chemical quality of litter may facilitate the naturalisation and invasion of exotic plants irrespective of their origin.","tags":["Litter Decomposition","Siwaliks"],"title":"Comparative litter decomposability traits of selected native and exotic woody species from an urban environment of north-western Siwalik region, India","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Meenu Patil","Abhishek Kumar","Pardeep Kumar","Anand Narain Singh"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

The variations in the rate of litter decomposition among different ecosystems may be controlled by several factors including climate, litter quality and soil biota. However, the rapid change in the environmental conditions is expected to alter the rate of litter decomposition resulting in modified nutrient cycling. This modified cycling of the nutrient may disrupt the ecosystem structure and functions followed by the compromised quality of ecosystem services and functions. Thus, an improved understanding is needed about the factors affecting the decomposition rates to sustain biodiversity and ecosystem services in a changing environment. In this article, we tried to explain the various physical, chemical and biological factors that affect the litter decomposition and nutrient cycling in the forest ecosystem. To accomplish this, we synthesized the available information by carrying out a literature survey from available databases. We found that there is a shifting paradigm from climatic control to species traits control of litter decomposition rate and recently even moving beyond it considering the effects of soil biota and habitat effects too. Further, the rate of decomposition rate is linked with the cycling of nutrients and climatic effects are expected to cascade into ecosystem functions and their services. In order to get a clear picture, however, intensive studies are required to explore the coupling effects of climatic variation on the structure and functioning behaviour of the forest ecosystems to maintain biodiversity and their services in a changing environment.","tags":["Litter Decomposition","Nutrient Cycling","Climate Change"],"title":"Litter decomposability traits and their linkage with the cycling of nutrients in the forest ecosystems under the lens of climate change: A conceptual overview","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abhishek Kumar","Meenu Patil","Pardeep Kumar","Shagun Saini","Anand Narain Singh"],"categories":null,"content":"\rAbhishek Kumar presented a research poster titled Plant response to Climate change: Herbarium can act as a tool for future research on plant-climate interactions at Second National Conference on Climate Change: Agriculture, Biodiversity and Human Health organised by the Clean and Green Environmental Society (CGES), Lucknow and CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI), Lucknow on February 22-23, 2020 held at CSIR-NBRI, Lucknow. This research poster has been awarded Third Prize. In this study, the authors have evaluated the temporal changes in leaf morphological traits using herbarium specimens. We found temporal changes mainly in 3 parameters of leaf morphological traits (i.e. leaf area, leaf length and leaf shape) of the grasses except leaf width. The increase in leaf area was correlated with the average atmospheric concentration of the year in which a particular species was collected. In conclusion, we found that plants are already responding to changing environmental conditions that evidently observed in the herbarium specimens. Therefore, herbarium can prove to be a good tool to understand plant-climate interactions in future studies.

It is likely that some of these plants may escape their site of introduction and become invasive in the adjacent forest patches. Such plants can potentially modify important ecosystem functions like cycling of nutrients by adjusting their decomposition rates, which in turn may facilitate their increased abundance in the invaded ecosystem. In order to test this hypothesis, we investigated the decomposition rates of five native and five exotic (three invasive and two non-invasive) species by litter bag experiment for a single year. Results indicated that invasive exotic species exhibited a higher rate of decomposition, whereas, non-invasive exotic species exhibited slower rates as compared to native species. However, present study did not find any significant differences in overall decomposition rates of native and exotic species but these rates were significantly correlated with physical traits of the initial litter. Interestingly, specific leaf area of initial litter was a good predictor for decomposition rates in the present study. Our study confirms that invasive exotic plants oriented to maintain a higher grade of physical quality of litter than native and non-invasive exotic species which promotes their faster decomposition in the urban ecosystems. In conclusion, a higher decomposition rate possibly due to better physical quality of litter may facilitate the naturalisation and invasion of exotic plants irrespective of their origin.\n","date":1581069600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581069600,"objectID":"d1ebd20173a577dcbc3d2b22ba66737b","permalink":"https://akumar.netlify.app/talk/2020-psc-longowal/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2020-psc-longowal/","section":"talk","summary":"Oral presentation at SLIET, Longowal.

However, limited information is available about the composition of herbaceous species during ecosystem re-development on mine dumps. The present study attempted to assess the composition of herbaceous vegetation beneath plantation stands of four native woody species on coal mine spoil in a dry tropical environment. After a thorough survey of the study site, total of 44 species of herbaceous plants belonging to 14 families were recorded. Among the recorded plant families, the Poaceae contributed the highest number of species (18) across all ages of all plantation stands. Biodiversity parameter such as species richness exhibited an increasing trend with age under plantation stand of T. grandis only, while the rest of the plantations showed a decreasing trend. In terms of similarity index, plantation stand of A. procera and T. grandis were closer to each other while A. lebbeck and D. strictus were farthest apart. Highest IVI was however recorded in the seedling of A. lebbeck under the planted stand of A. lebbeck while lowest of Rungia repens (2.85) under A. procera stands at 17th - year age. In conclusion, plantation age, dominant tree species, and species specificity has a significant impact on the development of herbaceous vegetation beneath plantation stand of four native woody species.","tags":["Plant Diversity","Restoration","Coal Mine"],"title":"Plant diversity development under planted woody species on coal mine spoil in a dry tropical environment, India: A case study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abhishek Kumar","Meenu Patil","Anand Narain Singh"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Here, we have shown that the term ‘Siwalik’ was most dominant in the available literature. Our analysed results strongly favoured the use of the term ‘Siwalik’ as it is the oldest and most frequently used term in both the major databases Scopus and Web of Science. India is the country that contributes the most to these variations in the spelling and also the articles published in Indian Journals have these variations. Therefore, we strongly recommend the use of the term ‘Siwalik’ while referring to the region.
