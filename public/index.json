Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the effects of woody plantations on coal mine spoil's physicochemical and biological properties. We synthesised the available data from previous studies conducted on 5-year-plantations in Singrauli coalfields of India. These plantations have monocultures of eight species, in which four were exotic (*Acacia auriculiformis*, *Casuarina equisetifolia*, *Cassia siamea* and *Grevillea pteridifolia*) and four were native species (*Albizia lebbeck*, *Albizia procera*, *Dendrocalamus strictus* and *Tectona grandis*).

The underlying cause of degradation includes natural settings (geological formation and climate change) and human-mediated pressures (sandstone mining, urbanisation and developmental activities). Since the Siwaliks is associated with the livelihood of about 20 million people, it becomes imperative to respond appropriately for sustaining this ecologically fragile region. Ecological principles have great potential to develop sustainable practices for the conservation and management of natural resources. These principles offer nature-based solutions to sustain the ecologically sensitive and degraded ecosystems such as the ‘Siwaliks’. However, there is a need for concerted research to develop data-driven decisions for effective management. Therefore, a systematic analysis was conducted to assess the current patterns and knowledge gaps about plant ecological studies in the Indian Siwalik region. This article analysed the available peer-reviewed literature using established guidelines and bibliometric analyses. We found an increasing trend in the scientific output, and most studies were concentrated in the Siwalik region belonging to the Indian state of Uttarakhand. Although studies have been conducted on plant ecology, landscape ecology and ecosystem ecology have been disproportionately focused. Our findings suggest a growing interest in the plant ecology of the region; however, these studies seem relatively small compared to the complexity and diversity of this ecosystem structural and functional attributes. Further, with advances in computer application and remote sensing satellite data availability, we observed a shift towards ecological modelling studies, though experimental evidence also needs to be addressed.","tags":["Plant Ecology","Siwaliks","Bibliometrics"],"title":"Plant ecology in Indian Siwalik range: a systematic map and its bibliometric analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["R","meta-analysis"],"content":"\r\rThe overall aim of meta-analyses is to combine the effects or observations from different studies. There are three main types of meta-analytic models i.e., fixed-effect model (FEM), random-effects model (REM), and multilevel model (MLM), which are commonly used to compute the overall effect estimate in meta-analysis. Multilevel meta-analytic models account for non-independence due to studies, species and phylogenetic relatedness between species, which is common for ecological meta-analyses.\nFixed-effects model\rThe most basic fixed-effect or common-effect model can be mathematically expressed as Equation (1)\n\\[\\begin{equation}\ry_i = \\mu + e_i; \\quad \\textbf{e} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\textbf{V})\r\\tag{1}\r\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere, \\(y_i\\) is the effect size for the \\(i^{th}\\) study (with \\(i = 1, \\ldots, N_{studies}\\)) with corresponding sampling variance \\(v_i\\), \\(\\mu\\) is the overall meta-analytic mean, \\(e_i\\) is the sampling error for the \\(i^{th}\\) study, \\(\\textbf{e}\\) is a \\(1 \\times N_{studies}\\) column vector with the \\(e_i\\) values (which are assumed to be normally distributed with mean \\(0\\) and variance \\(v_i\\)), \\(0\\) is a column vector of zeros and \\(\\textbf{V}\\) is an \\(N_{studies} \\times N_{studies}\\) matrix with the \\(v_i\\) values along the diagonal. However, this model is overly simplistic as it assumes homogeneity between studies which is far from the reality, at least for ecological studies.\n\rRandom-effects model\rIn contrary to the fixed effect model, the assumptions of random-effects model are more realistic as it considers between-study heterogeneity. This model assumes that there is not only one actual effect size but a distribution of true effect sizes. According to this model, the observed effect size \\(y_i\\) deviates from the mean true effect size \\(\\mu\\) for a single study \\(i\\) (with \\(i = 1, \\ldots , N_{studies}\\)) by two error terms \\(u_i\\) (between-study heterogeneity) and \\(e_i\\) (sampling error). Thus, the random effects model can be expressed as Equation (2)\n\\[\\begin{equation}\ry_i = \\mu + u_i + e_i; \\quad \\textbf{u} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_u^2 \\textbf{I}_u)\r\\tag{2}\r\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere, \\(u_i\\) is the random effect corresponding to the \\(i^{th}\\) estimate, \\(\\textbf{u}\\) is a \\(1 \\times N_{studies}\\) column vector with the \\(u_i\\) values (which are assumed to be normally distributed with mean \\(0\\) and variance \\(\\sigma_u^2\\)) and \\(\\textbf{I}_u\\) is an \\(N_{studies} \\times N_{studies}\\) identity matrix.\nAlthough the random-effects model is commonly used in ecology, it did not take into consideration the non-independence among effect sizes. The non-independence can arise when the effect sizes are shared by studies or species (i.e., multiple effect sizes from the same study or species). Further, phylogenetic relatedness among species can also introduce non-independence among the effect size estimates. This issue of non-independence can be addressed by using a multilevel (hierarchical) meta-analytic model, which considers a random effect at each level of variability in effect sizes. Among the several factor for non-independence of effect sizes, the dependence due to studies, species and phylogenetic relatedness among species are common in ecology.\n\rRandom-effects model at study level\rWhen a study provides more than one effect sizes, we have random effects at effect size (within studies) and study levels (between-study). To consider such non-independence due to studies, a multilevel model can be mathematically expressed as Equation (3)\n\\[\\begin{equation}\ry_{ij} = \\mu + u_{ij} + s_i + e_{ij}; \\quad \\textbf{s} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_s^2 \\textbf{I}_s) \\tag{3}\r\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere, \\(y_{ij}\\) denotes the \\(j^{th}\\) effect in the \\(i^{th}\\) study (with \\(j = 1, \\ldots, N_i\\), where \\(N_i\\) is the number of effect sizes reported in the \\(i^{th}\\) study), \\(v_{ij}\\) are the corresponding sampling variances, and \\(N_{total} = \\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{studies}} N_i\\) represents the total number of the effect sizes, \\(u_{ij}\\) is a random effect corresponding to the \\(j^{th}\\) effect size in the \\(i^{th}\\) study, \\(s_i\\) is a random effect at the study level, \\(\\textbf{u}\\) is now a \\(1 \\times N_{total}\\) column vector with the \\(u_{ij}\\) values, \\(\\textbf{s}\\) is a \\(1 \\times N_{studies}\\) column vector with the \\(s_i\\) values (which are assumed to be normally distributed with mean \\(0\\) and variance \\(\\sigma_s^2\\)), and \\(\\textbf{I}_u\\) and \\(\\textbf{I}_s\\) are \\(N_{total} \\times N_{total}\\) and \\(N_{studies} \\times N_{studies}\\) identity matrices, respectively.\n\rRandom-effects model at species level\rHowever, the above model in Equation (3) did not considers non-independence due to species, which is prevalent in ecology and evolution. If effect sizes belong to different species, we can denote \\(y_{ijk}\\) as the \\(j^{th}\\) effect in the \\(i^{th}\\) study for the \\(k^{th}\\) species (with \\(k = 1, \\ldots, N_{species}\\)). Then the multilevel model can include random effects at species level as expressed in Equation (4)\n\\[\\begin{equation}\ry_{ijk} = \\mu + u_{ij} + s_i + n_k + e_{ij}; \\quad \\textbf{n} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_n^2 \\textbf{I}_n)\r\\tag{4}\r\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere, \\(n_k\\) is a species-specific random effect, \\(\\textbf{n}\\) is a \\(1 \\times N_{species}\\) column vector with the \\(n_k\\) values (which are assumed to be normally distributed with mean \\(0\\) and between-species variance \\(\\sigma_n^2\\)) and \\(\\textbf{I}_n\\) has dimensions \\(N_{species} × N_{species}\\). In Equation (4), \\(n_k\\) is considered as crossed random effect instead of nested random effect.\n\rRandom-effects model at phylogenetic relatedness level\rTo account for non-independence due to phylogenetic relatedness, the multilevel model can be extended as Equation (5)\n\\[\\begin{equation}\ry_{ijk} = \\mu + u_{ij} + s_i + n_k + p_k + e_{ij}; \\quad\r\\textbf{p} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_p^2 \\textbf{A}) \\tag{5}\r\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere, \\(p_k\\) denotes the phylogenetic random effect for the \\(k^{th}\\) species,\r\\(\\textbf{p}\\) is a \\(1 \\times N_{species}\\) column vector with the \\(p_k\\) values (which are assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution with mean \\(0\\) and variance–covariance matrix \\(\\sigma_p^2 \\textbf{A}\\), where \\(\\sigma_p^2\\) denotes between-species variance due to the phylogeny, and \\(\\textbf{A}\\) is the \\(N_{species} \\times N_{species}\\) phylogenetic correlation matrix).\nThe model in Equation (5) includes both non-phylogenetic (\\(n_k\\)) and phylogenetic(\\(p_k\\)) random effect due to species. Concerning the potential bias in estimated variances, we can simplify this model by removing the non-phylogenetic random effects as represented in Equation (6)\n\\[\\begin{equation}\ry_{ijk} = \\mu + u_{ij} + s_i + p_k + e_{ij}; \\quad\r\\textbf{p} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_p^2 \\textbf{A})\r\\tag{6}\r\\end{equation}\\]\n\r","date":1644019200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644001623,"objectID":"61d116d6814d760715452bfe0562abc7","permalink":"https://akumar.netlify.app/post/meta-analytic-models-in-ecology/","publishdate":"2022-02-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/meta-analytic-models-in-ecology/","section":"post","summary":"The overall aim of meta-analyses is to combine the effects or observations from different studies.

This problem has been increasing due to anthropogenic activities that affect the soils’ physical, chemical and biological properties with unprecedented rates. Thus, among various remediation technologies for soil contamination management, phytoremediation has emerged as a promising cost-effective and sustainable technology. Therefore, the present chapter highlights the recent developments in the concept, types, mechanisms of this phytoremediation as a cost-effective technology for contaminated soils along with future perspectives. Available literature suggests that it is a better technology to remediate contaminated sites than conventional strategies and is considered a cost-effective and eco-friendly tool. Phytoremediation includes a range of plant-based remediation techniques such as rhizofiltration, phytostabilization, phytoextraction, phytovolatilization and phytodegradation focused on a different degree of remediation mechanisms. Further, recent developments in understanding the mechanism of phytoremediation have opened the window for the engineering of plants for effective remediation of contaminants. However, the information regarding which plant species is ideal and appropriate for a specific type of waste and its mechanism of phytoremediation is not fully synthesized. Therefore, to find out suitable plant species for Phytoremediation purposes based on needs and mechanisms whenever is required in a changing environment is mandatory. It is also expected that ecological evaluation of the desirable and most applicable, especially indigenous plants that probably can play a promising role in the development of a database for future research aspects in remediation and decontamination of limited air, water and soil resources of the biosphere.","tags":["Phytoremediation","Soil Contamination"],"title":"Phytoremediation: A wonderful cost-effective tool","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anand Narain Singh","Abhishek Kumar"],"categories":null,"content":"\r Click the Cite button above to copy or download citation for reference management software.

These large heaps of overburdened materials can act as a serious threat to ecological integrity and, therefore, overall societal well-being. Plantations are often employed to establish revegetation and management of mine spoil, thus mitigating the effects of mining on the environment. However, the performance of plant species can be highly variable due to environmental and species-specific effects. Therefore, the present paper's primary objective is to compare exotic (*Acacia auriculiformis*, *Cassia siamea*, *Casuarina equisetifolia* and *Grevillea pteridifolia*) and native (*Albizia lebbeck*, *Albizia procera*, *Dendrocalamus strictus* and *Tectona grandis*) species' performance on the coal mine spoils. Previous studies on the Singrauli coalfields allowed us to compare the growth performance, standing biomass, and net primary production (NPP) of four exotic and four native species plantations. Our results showed that native species have significantly higher survival, stem diameter, biomass, and NPP than exotic woody plantations. Thus, exotic species might not be useful in mine spoil rehabilitation than the native species. Overall, this study suggests that native species are useful for mine spoil rehabilitation despite the faster growth of exotic species.","tags":["Coal mine","Restoration"],"title":"Ecological performances of exotic and native woody species on coal mine spoil in Indian dry tropical region","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pardeep Kumar","Abhishek Kumar","Meenu Patil","Nitin Kumar Sharma","Anand Narain Singh"],"categories":null,"content":"\r Click the Cite button above to copy or download citation for reference management software.

Since mining activities for coal and minerals are prime industrial activities in this region; therefore, through these activities, a significant size of dry tropical forest ecosystems is destroying at unprecedented rates. Thus, the primary objective of the present study was to understand the influence of planted woody species on herbaceous biomass development. Estimation of herbaceous biomass was accomplished once in 1995 and 2007 under plantation stand of four native woody species. Among planted woody species, maximum herbaceous biomass was quantified at the 5th-year stand of *Tectona grandis* and lowest at the 17th-year stand of *Dendrocalamus strictus*. Family Poaceae contributed the maximum in herbaceous biomass production across all plantation stands. A declining trend was observed in herbaceous biomass production as the age of plantation stand increases, reflecting the impact of stand characteristics such as woody species basal cover and canopy cover on herbaceous vegetation development. Herbaceous biomass was positively correlated with species diversity at both ages of plantation stands, emphasising the facilitative role of species for organic matter build-up in disturbed habitats. However, increased competition between herbaceous species for space, nutrients and decreased penetration of light through the closed canopy of planted woody trees significantly influences herbaceous diversity under plantation stand.","tags":["Biomass","Restoration","Coal Mine"],"title":"Herbaceous vegetation under planted woody species on coal mine spoil acts as a source of organic

Homogeneity of variances\nThe classical one-way ANOVA test requires an assumption of equal variances for\rall groups. The residuals versus fits plot can be used to check the homogeneity\rof variances.\nplot(mod, 1)\rIn the above plot, there is no evident relationships between residuals and fitted\rvalues (the mean of each groups), which is good. So, we can assume the homogeneity\rof variances.\nIt’s also possible to use Bartlett’s test or Levene’s test to check the\rhomogeneity of variances. I recommend Levene’s test, which is less sensitive to\rdepartures from normal distribution.\nbartlett.test(obs ~ season, data = dat_long) |\u0026gt; broom::tidy() |\u0026gt; gt::gt()\rhtml

In this plot, the quantiles of the residuals\rare plotted against the quantiles of the normal distribution.

These fine roots sustain plant survival through the acquisition of water and nutrients from the soil. Fine roots are highly dynamic, having a small life span and a frequent turn-over which contribute to significant carbon input to the soil. Despite their importance to the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients, our understanding of fine root biomass, turn-over and dynamics are still impoverished, especially in tropical forests. Therefore, the present chapter is aimed to provide an overview for fine root biomass production, turn-over and their foraging efficiency under different environmental conditions. Fine root dynamics are profoundly influenced by several environmental factors such as seasonality, soil temperature and moisture, nutrient heterogeneity, as well as temporal and spatial variations in measuring techniques. Under nutrient heterogeneity, trees adopt different foraging strategies for resource acquisition through plasticity in morphological and physiological traits of fine roots. The type of plasticity responses varies widely among species and ecosystem types and nutrient patches. Tropical forests are highly sensitive to altered climatic conditions such as CO$_2$ enrichment, and anthropogenic nitrogen deposition. The available evidence indicates that fine root increases under CO$_2$ enrichment, while a negative correlation was observed with N addition in tropical forests. Despite playing a pivotal role in global carbon (C) cycling, the contribution of fine roots to ecosystem C models is poorly represented, probably due to difficulty in quantifying its precise quantity. Therefore, to understand the function and behaviour of tropical forest ecosystems under altered environmental conditions, broadspectrum studies are needed to gain information about fine root dynamics and their nutrient exploration efficiency.","tags":["Litter Decomposition","Carbon Dynamics","Tropical Forest"],"title":"Foraging efficiency of fine roots in relation to carbon dynamics in the tropical ecosystems in a changing environment: A synthesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pardeep Kumar","Deepika Antil","Abhishek Kumar","Meenu Patil","Anand Narain Singh"],"categories":null,"content":"  Click the Cite button above to copy or import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Importantly, they act as a natural sink for atmospheric CO$_2$ and play a pivotal role to offset climate change and related environmental perturbations. Unfortunately, due to the mounting pressure of the increasing human population to sustain a livelihood for food, timber, medicine, tropical forests are subjected to land-use change, deforestation, and degradation by industrial activities, especially mining. In addition to this, global climate change (increasing CO$_2$ concentration, temperature, drought, and fires might have a disproportional effect on carbon (C) flux in the tropical forests. The changes above should be considered in tropical dry forests (TDFs) research because these forests often neglected over rain forests despite having a sizeable geographical extent and significant pool of C in vegetation and soil. In the wake of the elevated concentration of atmospheric CO$_2$, the net gain in net primary productivity (NPP) and forest growth rate is getting consideration for tropical forests today, meanwhile other factors like temperature, drought, and fire likely to negate the positive effect of increased CO$_2$ concentration in the atmosphere. Recent studies designate tropical forests overall as C neutral since the loss of carbon due to deforestation and degradation is compensated by regrowth and recovery of past disturbances. So, there is an immense potential in the tropical forests to curb elevated CO$_2$ if policies and afforestation provisions and initiatives such as REDD+ if implemented effectively at the global level. In this chapter, we address the current state of knowledge on C stock and flux, and the magnitude of various disturbances (land-use change, deforestation), climatic perturbations (elevated CO$_2$, increased temperature, drought, and fires) on carbon balance in the tropical forests. Furthermore, we also discuss various research gaps for sustaining its structure, function, and ecosystem services; and recent methodological advancements for the estimation of C stock in the tropical forests.","tags":["Carbon Dynamics","Tropical Forest"],"title":"Impact of changing environment on carbon dynamics in tropics with special focus on tropical dry forest ecosystems: A synthesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abhishek Kumar","Meenu Patil","Pardeep Kumar","Anand Narain Singh"],"categories":null,"content":"  Click the Cite button above to copy or download the publication metadata into your reference management software.

These ecosystems substantially control global nutrient cycling. Although our understanding of carbon and nitrogen cycling has considerably improved during the past decades, phosphorus cycling in tropical forests still remains poorly understood. Tropical forests are characterized by severe phosphorus limitation and very high productivity at the same time. This suggests that tropical plants must have the capacity to adapt to such nutrient-poor environments, which should be reflected in the nutrient concentration of plant tissues via their phosphorus resorption efficiencies and the overall phosphorus cycling. This chapter aims to provide the general patterns and mechanisms of phosphorus cycling in tropical forests. Based on the available evidence, we first overview the general nutrient cycling pattern, then highlight the mechanisms of phosphorus control, and finally discuss the possible responses to climate change. Actually, phosphorus cycling involves soil, plant biomass, and litter as the storage components, and recycling of phosphorus takes place among these components. However, due to substantial loss of nutrients, the cycling of phosphorus tends to slow down with time. Studies involving the external supply of phosphorus have suggested a considerable enhancement in the phosphorus cycle, but this enhancement could not sustain over time. Climatic factors generally control many processes of nutrient cycling; therefore, ongoing climate change has been expected to alter the phosphorus cycling in the tropical forests as well. The available evidence suggests that warm-moist conditions will favor faster litter decomposition rates, whereas seasonality in precipitation will slow down the nutrient cycling. Therefore, in this chapter, we tried to answer how litter decomposability traits and the addition of phosphorus nutrient are controlling the cycling of nutrients in the tropical forest ecosystems under changing environmental conditions.","tags":["Litter Decomposition","Phosphorus","Tropical Forest"],"title":"Phosphorus and litter decomposability traits in tropical forest ecosystems under changing environment: A synthesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rajni Yadav","Abhishek Kumar","Diksha Tokas","Anand Narain Singh"],"categories":null,"content":"  Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

To accomplish this, we extensively surveyed the available databases like Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, NCBI including PubMed and PubChem, etc. by using keywords ‘Mallotus philippensis’, ‘Mallotus phillippinensis’ and ‘Mallotus philippinensis’. Our results indicated that the tree possesses more than 50 different types of important phytochemicals of natural origin. The wide array of phytochemicals possesses fascinating biological activities like anthelmintic, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-cancerous, anti-tuberculosis, anti-parasitic, analgesic, anti-urolithiatic and anti-viral activities. Thus, pharmacological activities and isolation of active phytochemicals make the tree a promising candidate for drug discovery. However, pharmacological activities such as antibacterial and anti-oxidant activities are often tested with crude extracts and in vitro rudimentary methods that can be sometimes misleading and non-specific. Thus, more sophisticated techniques may be applied for the isolation of active chemicals and elucidating their mechanism of actions.","tags":["Mallotus philippensis","Ethnobiology","Pharmacology","Phytochemistry"],"title":"Mallotus philippensis (Lam.)

Understanding its mechanistic role for community assembly can provide evidence to understand weed-crop interactions, and in particular, how weeds impact on crop production. In this article, we tried to explain the various traits specifically leaf functional traits (LFTs) used to know the level of competition between crop and weeds under the agro-ecosystem. To accomplish this, we synthesized the available information by carrying out a literature survey and standardized protocols from available databases showing the variation in the respective traits of crop and weeds. And, it is found that there are certain specific LFTs such as leaf area, leaf size and specific leaf area are helpful to calculate the level of competition under weed crop interactions. So, these traits proved to be a good tool to screen out species for productivity and ecological performance in the species interactions. This confirms with previous findings that knowledge to measure the LFTs can improve the yield in response to weed competition and can be implemented by the farmers in the field. Also, this array of traits can help to minimize the use of different chemicals (weedicides, herbicides and pesticides) in weeds management under agro-ecosystems which affect the biotic factors such as soil biota. However, more studies are required to explore the utility of these traits under weed-crop interactions in the agro-ecosystems.","tags":"","title":"Novelty of plant functional approaches under weed-crop interactions particularly leaf functional traits of the wheat crop: A synthesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abhishek Kumar","Meenu Patil","Pardeep Kumar","Ram Chand Bhatti","Rupinder Kaur","Nitin Kumar Sharma","Anand Narain Singh"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Though these protected areas seem to be supportive of the biodiversity conservation, several challenges and gaps have emerged that need to be addressed for effective conservation and sustainable management in these protected areas. Therefore, the present chapter aims to address the roles, challenges, and approaches for conservation, and sustainable management in protected areas of India. Based on the published literature, we have found that protected areas proved to be a successful strategy for the conservation of wild animals and plants. However, management of poaching, man-wildlife conflicts, funding, extensive resource use, and tourism is still a challenge for some national parks of the country. Although governmental policies have addressed some of these challenges, only limited success has been achieved so far.

The variations in the rate of litter decomposition among different ecosystems may be controlled by several factors including climate, litter quality and soil biota. However, the rapid change in the environmental conditions is expected to alter the rate of litter decomposition resulting in modified nutrient cycling. This modified cycling of the nutrient may disrupt the ecosystem structure and functions followed by the compromised quality of ecosystem services and functions. Thus, an improved understanding is needed about the factors affecting the decomposition rates to sustain biodiversity and ecosystem services in a changing environment. In this article, we tried to explain the various physical, chemical and biological factors that affect the litter decomposition and nutrient cycling in the forest ecosystem. To accomplish this, we synthesized the available information by carrying out a literature survey from available databases. We found that there is a shifting paradigm from climatic control to species traits control of litter decomposition rate and recently even moving beyond it considering the effects of soil biota and habitat effects too. Further, the rate of decomposition rate is linked with the cycling of nutrients and climatic effects are expected to cascade into ecosystem functions and their services. In order to get a clear picture, however, intensive studies are required to explore the coupling effects of climatic variation on the structure and functioning behaviour of the forest ecosystems to maintain biodiversity and their services in a changing environment.","tags":["Litter Decomposition","Nutrient Cycling","Climate Change"],"title":"Litter decomposability traits and their linkage with the cycling of nutrients in the forest ecosystems under the lens of climate change: A conceptual overview","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abhishek Kumar","Meenu Patil","Pardeep Kumar","Shagun Saini","Anand Narain Singh"],"categories":null,"content":"Abhishek Kumar presented a research poster titled Plant response to Climate change: Herbarium can act as a tool for future research on plant-climate interactions at Second National Conference on Climate Change: Agriculture, Biodiversity and Human Health organised by the Clean and Green Environmental Society (CGES), Lucknow and CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI), Lucknow on February 22-23, 2020 held at CSIR-NBRI, Lucknow.

It is likely that some of these plants may escape their site of introduction and become invasive in the adjacent forest patches. Such plants can potentially modify important ecosystem functions like cycling of nutrients by adjusting their decomposition rates, which in turn may facilitate their increased abundance in the invaded ecosystem. In order to test this hypothesis, we investigated the decomposition rates of five native and five exotic (three invasive and two non-invasive) species by litter bag experiment for a single year. Results indicated that invasive exotic species exhibited a higher rate of decomposition, whereas, non-invasive exotic species exhibited slower rates as compared to native species. However, present study did not find any significant differences in overall decomposition rates of native and exotic species but these rates were significantly correlated with physical traits of the initial litter. Interestingly, specific leaf area of initial litter was a good predictor for decomposition rates in the present study. Our study confirms that invasive exotic plants oriented to maintain a higher grade of physical quality of litter than native and non-invasive exotic species which promotes their faster decomposition in the urban ecosystems. In conclusion, a higher decomposition rate possibly due to better physical quality of litter may facilitate the naturalisation and invasion of exotic plants irrespective of their origin.\n","date":1581069600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581069600,"objectID":"d1ebd20173a577dcbc3d2b22ba66737b","permalink":"https://akumar.netlify.app/talk/2020-psc-longowal/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2020-psc-longowal/","section":"talk","summary":"An example talk using Wowchemy's Markdown slides feature.","tags":["Litter decomposition","Siwalik"],"title":"Litter decomposability traits as a tool for plant invasion in an urban environment of north-western Siwalik region, India","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Pardeep Kumar","Abhishek Kumar","Meenu Patil","Nitin Kumar Sharma","Anand Narain Singh"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

However, limited information is available about the composition of herbaceous species during ecosystem re-development on mine dumps. The present study attempted to assess the composition of herbaceous vegetation beneath plantation stands of four native woody species on coal mine spoil in a dry tropical environment. After a thorough survey of the study site, total of 44 species of herbaceous plants belonging to 14 families were recorded. Among the recorded plant families, the Poaceae contributed the highest number of species (18) across all ages of all plantation stands. Biodiversity parameter such as species richness exhibited an increasing trend with age under plantation stand of T. grandis only, while the rest of the plantations showed a decreasing trend. In terms of similarity index, plantation stand of A. procera and T. grandis were closer to each other while A. lebbeck and D. strictus were farthest apart. Highest IVI was however recorded in the seedling of A. lebbeck under the planted stand of A. lebbeck while lowest of Rungia repens (2.85) under A. procera stands at 17th - year age. In conclusion, plantation age, dominant tree species, and species specificity has a significant impact on the development of herbaceous vegetation beneath plantation stand of four native woody species.","tags":["Plant Diversity","Restoration","Coal Mine"],"title":"Plant diversity development under planted woody species on coal mine spoil in a dry tropical environment, India: A case study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Abhishek Kumar","Meenu Patil","Anand Narain Singh"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

These spelling variants are creating hindrances to acquiring a complete knowledge about the region. Therefore, the present study has applied bibliometric analysis to resolve the inconsistency about the usage of these terms. Here, we have shown that the term ‘Siwalik’ was most dominant in the available literature. Our analysed results strongly favoured the use of the term ‘Siwalik’ as it is the oldest and most frequently used term in both the major databases Scopus and Web of Science. India is the country that contributes the most to these variations in the spelling and also the articles published in Indian Journals have these variations. Therefore, we strongly recommend the use of the term ‘Siwalik’ while referring to the region. Thus, the present article can serve as a guide to adopt a suitable term for the authors and publishers.","tags":["Siwaliks","Bibliometrics"],"title":"Siwalik, Shivalik, Shiwalik or Sivalik: Which one is an appropriate term for the foothills of Himalayas?","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
